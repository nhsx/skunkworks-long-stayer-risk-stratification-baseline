# NHS AI Lab Skunkworks project: Long Stayer risk stratification baseline models

> A internal capability project for the NHS AI (Artificial Intelligence) Lab Skunkworks team, Long Stayer risk stratification baseline models seeks to provide simple baseline models for predicting length of stay (days) in a secondary care setting.

Long Stayer risk stratification baseline models was selected as a project to run in tandem with the [NHS AI Lab Skunkworks project: Long Stayer Risk Stratification](https://github.com/nhsx/skunkworks-long-stayer-risk-stratification) project, and started in March 2022.

Baseline models provide a mechanism to generate baseline metrics to assess the performance of more complex models, and establish the effectiveness of simple approaches.

**Intended audience:** analysts and data scientists at NHS Trusts/ALBs

## Intended Use

The work contained in this repository is experimental research and is intended to demonstrate the technical validity of applying machine learning models to medical records datasets in order to predict length of stay. It is not intended for deployment in a clinical or non-clinical setting without further development and compliance with the [UK Medical Device Regulations 2002](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2002/618/contents/made) where the product qualifies as a medical device.

## Data Protection

This project was subject to a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) and Data Processing Agreement (DPA), ensuring the protection of the data used in line with the [UK Data Protection Act 2018](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2018/12/contents/enacted) and [UK GDPR](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/dp-at-the-end-of-the-transition-period/data-protection-and-the-eu-in-detail/the-uk-gdpr/). No data or trained models are shared in this repository.

## Background

Hospital long stayers, those with a length of stay (LoS) of 21 days or longer, have significantly worse medical and social outcomes than other patients. Long-stayers are often medically optimised (fit for discharge) many days before their actual discharge. Moreover, there are a complex mixture of medical, cultural and socioeconomic factors which contribute to the causes of unnecessary long stays.

This project aims to complement [previous work](https://github.com/nhsx/skunkworks-long-stayer-risk-stratification) by generating simple baseline regression and classification models that could be replicated at other hospital trusts, and is divided into two phases:

1. Phase 1: Series of Jupyter Notebooks containing baseline model code
2. Phase 2: [Reproducible Analytical Pipeline](https://github.com/NHSDigital/rap-community-of-practice) including data pipelines

Currently, this repository delivers **Phase 1**.

## Overview

This repository contains a series of [notebooks](notebooks/) which implement the data science pipeline for model development:

1. Data loading
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Data cleaning
4. Feature engineering
5. Modelling
6. Evaluation

> The results of the analysis are available in the [technical write-up](https://nhsx.github.io/skunkworks/long-stay-baseline).

## Population

* The population for this project is defined as non-elective, major cases as recorded in an acute hospital trust electronic patient record.
* This population includes patients with a length of stay of 0 days, ie. day patients.
* Features selected are available on admission.

A data dictionary of fields is available [here](docs/data-dictionary.csv).

## Data pipeline

Anonymised data was exported from Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trusts Data Warehouse:

## Model selection

Simple baseline models were implemented using commonly available packages including [scikit-learn 1.1.1](https://scikit-learn.org/), [CatBoost 1.0.6](https://catboost.ai) and [XGBoost 1.3.3](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

Models were trained with default parameters and evaluated on the validation set. The best performing model was then tuned using 5-fold crossvalidation implemented with `GridSearchCV` on the training set. The final performance was measured on the test set.

* A series of **regression** models were developed to predict **Length of Stay (days)**.
* A series of **classification** models were developed to predict a **risk score** of becoming a long-stayer, according to the following mapping:

Risk Category|Day Range for Risk Category
-----|------
1 - Very low risk|0-6
2 - Low risk|7-10
3 - Normal risk|11-13
4 - Elevated risk|14-15
5 - High risk|>15

The best performing models were compared by calculating an equivalent risk score from the predicted length of stay (catboost in both cases).

## Model training

### Regression

* Regression models were trained using default loss functions and evaluated using **root mean squared error (RMSE)**. RMSE accounts for both positive and negative errors, and penalises larger errors more. The final value is also in the same units as the target feature (days) so easier to interpret (although non-linear)..
* The final regression model was also evaluated using the `mean_absolute_error` metric which gives a more human-understandable measure of performance - the number of days the length of stay is incorrect.

### Classification

> Postscript: classification models based on increasing risk (1-5) are ordinal in nature, and an appropriate model should be used where different classes are not treated as independent as per the examples in this repo.

* Classification models were trained and evaluated using `f1_weighted`. The F1 score is the harmonic mean of the precision and recall, and helps balance the performance of the classifier. The weighted F1 score was chosen due to class imbalance present in the dataset (ie. long stayers are a minority, even in major cases).
* Classification models were also evaluated using `balanced_accuracy` and `auc_roc` to compare performance across metrics.

## Known limitations

1. The pre-processing stages of the notebooks are tied to the specific extract from Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, and will need modifying to work on different datasets. A pipeline version of this project is due for development and sharing in this repository.
2. Data loading functionality is specific to the Azure Machine Learning environment used for this project.
3. Feature engineering is basic, with no external datasets included in the analysis, and no free-text fields used.
4. The exclusion of minor incidents reduced the available data by 70%, and should be reviewed.

## Directory structure

The directory structure of this project includes **data stored outside of the git tree**. This is to ensure that, when coding in the open, no data can accidentally be committed to the repository through either the use of `git push -f` to override a `.gitignore` file, or through ignoring the `pre-commit` hooks.

A `project-directory` must first be created, inside of which this repository can be cloned (into e.g. `repo-directory`).

`data` and `models` folders will be stored at the highest level, outside the git tree, and must be created manually first, including the subdirectories `data/interim`, `data/processed` and `data/raw`:
