# NHS AI Lab Skunkworks project: {PROJECT NAME}

> A pilot project for the NHS AI (Artificial Intelligence) Lab Skunkworks team, {PROJECT NAME} {SHORT DESCRIPTION}

{PROJECT NAME} was selected as a project in {DATE SELECTED} following a succesful pitch to the AI Skunkworks problem-sourcing programme.

## Intended Use

This proof of concept ([TRL 4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_readiness_level)) is intended to demonstrate the technical validity of applying X technique to Y dataset in order to solve Z. It is not intended for deployment in a clinical or non-clinical setting without further development and compliance with the [UK Medical Device Regulations 2002](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2002/618/contents/made) where the product qualifies as a medical device.

## Data Protection

This project was subject to a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA), ensuring the protection of the data used in line with the [UK Data Protection Act 2018](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2018/12/contents/enacted) and [UK GDPR](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/dp-at-the-end-of-the-transition-period/data-protection-and-the-eu-in-detail/the-uk-gdpr/). No data or trained models are shared in this repository.

## Background

_Include a high-level summary of what the problem you are trying to solve is._

## Model selection

_Include a high-level rationale of the approach you took._

## Known limitations

_Include known limitations and issues with your approach._

## Data pipeline

_Include an ideally visual representation of data flow, and include a link to a data dictionary/data requirements._

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository: `git clone git@github.com:nhsx/skunkworks-template.git`
2. Switch to the `develop` branch: `git branch develop`
3. Create a new virtual environment: `mkvirtualenv my-project` or `pyenv virtualenv 3.8.5 my-project`
4. Install the requirements of this template: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Enable pre-commits: `pre-commit install`

_Include a brief overview of the codebase. Include setup and execution instructions, including any required environment variables. Consider using a `virtual environment` for dependency management._

## NHS AI Lab Skunkworks
The project is supported by the NHS AI Lab Skunkworks, which exists within the NHS AI Lab at NHSX to support the health and care community to rapidly progress ideas from the conceptual stage to a proof of concept.
