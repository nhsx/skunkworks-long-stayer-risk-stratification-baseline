# NHS AI Lab Skunkworks project: Length of Stay baseline predictive models

> A internal capability project for the NHS AI (Artificial Intelligence) Lab Skunkworks team, Length of Stay baseline predictive models seeks to provide simple baseline models for predicting length of stay (days) in a secondary care setting.

Length of Stay baseline predictive models was selected as a project to run in tandem with the [NHS AI Lab Skunkworks project: Long Stayer Risk Stratification](https://github.com/nhsx/skunkworks-long-stayer-risk-stratification), and started in March 2022.

## Background

Hospital long stayers, those with a length of stay (LoS) of 21 days or longer, have significantly worse medical and social outcomes than other patients. Long-stayers are often medically optimised (fit for discharge) many days before their actual discharge. Moreover, there are a complex mixture of medical, cultural and socioeconomic factors which contribute to the causes of unnecessary long stays.

The AI Lab Skunkworks team commissioned a [Long Stayer Risk Stratification](https://github.com/nhsx/skunkworks-long-stayer-risk-stratification) model in April 2021 using some approaches from Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), including a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to predict Length of Stay.

This project aims to complement that work with simpler baseline models that could be replicated at other hospital trusts.

## Under development

This project is currently under active development, which can be followed in the [`develop`](tree/develop) branch here on Github.

When the project is completed the [`develop`](tree/develop) branch will be merged into the `main` branch as a release.

## NHS AI Lab Skunkworks

The project is supported by the NHS AI Lab Skunkworks, which exists within the NHS AI Lab within the NHS Transformation Directorate, to support the health and care community to rapidly progress ideas from the conceptual stage to a proof of concept.
